const INTRO_T = `
A vascular disease that typically affects the circulatory system and is characterised by 
abnormalities in the blood vessels â€“ arteries, capillaries and veins. It is characterized by inflammation of the large and 
medium-sized arteries that supply blood to the head, predominantly the temporal arteries
located on the sides of the head. It is most common in patients between ages 60-70.
It is also known as giant cell arteritis (GCA).
`;

const OBJECTIVE = `
The objective of the research was to compare the cell types represented
in diseased temporal artery tissues and determine what cell type(s) are most likely to play a huge role in 
the diseased state of Temporal Arteritis.
`;

const INTRO_P = `
The research objective was achieved by obtaining a suitable dataset and subsequent processing.
`;

const DATASET = `
Temporal arterial tissues were donated by 6 patients. This included three (3) diseased arterial 
tissues and three (3) healthy arterial tissues. The dataset was obtained by conducting single-cell
RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of cells and genes in the donated arterial tissues.

const PROCESS_TOOLS = `
was used to observe the genes in both disease and control cells. UMAPS (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection)
is a dimensionality reduction technique commonly used in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis and genomics. It compresses 
datasets in a form that allows easy represention in 2D latent space. This includes complex relationships within the dataset.
`;

const CELL_STATUS = `After further processing, the UMAPS was able to separate the cluster of cells and genes in the dataset
into individual cell types with their genes. The individual cell types shows the diseased (neg) and healthy (pos) genes overlapped to 
showcase which cell type has a higher likelihood of influencing the diseased state of the temporal artery.`;

const CLUSTERS = `
The UMAPS presented the entire dataset as a cluster of cell types with their genes. 
`;

const CONCLUSION = ` 
From the analysis of the dataset, the Immune, VSMC-1 and Fibroplast-1 cell types are more likely to play a huge role in the diseased state of the temporal artery.
Understanding the visualized results will help in utilizing scRNA-seq analysis in many real-world medical practices including:
